\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank to my supervisor for giving me a lot of trust and understanding, so I could organise my working time in the most suitable way. There was many perturbations on the way and although stress and unlucky events, I have never been criticised or nag but rather admired for my work. This gave me power to go through the moments where I doubted if my skills and expertise are up to the task.

Of course I would like to thank to the whole team working on the car, I believe it was great experience for us all. Here I would like to give special acknowledge to Martin who kept me company during never ending days in the laboratory it was really nice to have someone to talk to time to time.

Moreover, I would like to thank to my boss, as I cannot rely on any financial support I needed simultaneously work through the whole period of my master studies. I felt anxious about it as it was my first long term job, however I was given a lot of recognition and flexibility which made it possible for me to attend and complete this degree.

Last but not least I would like to tank to my family for their never-ending mental support and never questioning my decisions. You are the root of each and every one of my little sucesses.
