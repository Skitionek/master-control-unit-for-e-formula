\chapter{Overview of experimental setup}
Having not sufficient financial support enforced many compromises on design which I did not have direct influence on. The decision was made that will be running in low voltage - high current setup so we could use cost efficient lithium-ion batteries. 
Although theoretically possible cabling and connector sizing was a bit overwhelming for responsible teams.

In our final setup we used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Two EMRAX228 motors which nominal power of about 50kW (when liquid cooled)
    \item Two emDrive500 controllers capable full usage of AM motors
    \item Arduinos with CAN shields to act as intelligent sensors/controllers
    \item Two \todo{which pump?} pumps for cooling purposes
    \item National Instruments' cRIO 9033 as a main control unit
\end{itemize}

This result in system which in simplified manner has been presented in figure \todo{figure ref}.

As shown all the communication with master control unit is based on CAN bus.
