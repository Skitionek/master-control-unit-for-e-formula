\chapter{Conclusion}

1. Introduction
Your introduction has two main purposes: 1) to give an overview of the main points of your thesis, and 2) to awaken the reader’s interest. It is recommended to rewrite the introduction one last time when the writing is done, to ensure that it connects well with your conclusion.

Tip: For a nice, stylistic twist you can reuse a theme from the introduction in your conclusion. For example, you might present a particular scenario in one way in your introduction, and then return to it in your conclusion from a different – richer or contrasting – perspective.

The introduction should include:

The background for your choice of theme
A discussion of your research question or thesis statement
A schematic outline of the remainder of your thesis
The sections below discuss each of these elements in turn.
